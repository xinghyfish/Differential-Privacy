# Preview

This repository is some notes of **DP( Differential Privacy )**, and this is my first one. Writing is a perfect way to share our ideas and find out what we are unable to grasp. So I decide to make some notes and put the notes on my GitHub.

Compared to other repositories on GitHub, this one focuses on the concepts of DP and the process of put the mathematical theory into practice. I will try my best to make it easy to understand by beginner. If it brings you convenience, you can give it a **star**:star: and share it with others.

The rest content will be updated continuously.
